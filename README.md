## Problem Statement

Trade businesses struggle to expand their business due to various factors. Such factors are the lack of knowledge of the new 4IR workspace, poor advertisements, and over-reliance on word of mouth to spread awareness about their business. Considering the advertisement factor, it is clear that these small businesses spend a lot of money and effort to get their businesses known but they barely get new clients interested in their business. Furthermore, new trade businesses struggle to establish themselves in this competitive industry so getting their feet on the ground seems like a difficult mountain to climb. In the long run, these advertisements do not effectively reach the targeted audience as social media is saturated with many different people who are there for different reasons, so in turn merchants are unable to obtain prospective customers.

## Solution

With the problem in hand, the solution through our system is to conveniently provide to the client: good, reliable merchants with ease through location proximity to potential a merchant. In terms of the merchant, the merchants will find more clients with relatively reduced costs for advertising as our software will be primarily centered around advertisement and connecting clients and merchants together at low costs. Thus software benefits all parties present, including the client, merchant and the software itself through creating a common ground for these parties.
